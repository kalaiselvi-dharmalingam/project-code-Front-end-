        Although Hiphop is a duo,[4] Jeeva has seldom made public appearances, thus associating the name Hiphop Tamizha with Adhi more often. Adhi told IndiaGlitz that this is due to his shyness, and compared his partner to the unseen lion in the emblem of India, which includes four lions, with only three visible.[12] Jeeva adopted the moniker Jeeva Beatz sometime after the two met in 2005.[1][9]

Adhi studied at Chavara Vidya Bhavan and Electrical Engineering at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology. He holds a state-level rank in Tamil Nadu Common Entrance Test and is a graduate in Master of Business Administration from the Department of Management Studies, University of Madras. As of October 2014, he was doing a PhD course at Bharathiar University,[9] which he completed in June 2015.[13] Jeeva is an alumnus of Loyola College, Chennai.[14]

On 30 November 2017, Adhi married Latchaya Devareddy, in a private ceremony at Tirupati.[15][16]
